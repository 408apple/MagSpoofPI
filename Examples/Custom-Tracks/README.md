Example of how a script could be use to modify MagSpoofPI.c before install.

In this particular example, I splitted the MagSpoofPI.c in two files: headMagSpoofPI and tailMagSpoofPI.
Just to modify the "tracks" variable before make and install and then generate the new MagSpoofPI.c.

run:
sudo python ExampleTracks.py
